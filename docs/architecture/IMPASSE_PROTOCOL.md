# The Impasse Protocol

> The goal isn't to build an AI that never gets stuck. It's to build a partnership that is unstoppable.

## Autonomous Diagnostics
When an obstacle is encountered, the initial response is a rigorous, exhaustive, and autonomous diagnostic protocol. All known debugging steps will be performed. Every attempt and its outcome will be logged internally. This phase is governed by pure persistence and systematic exploration of the solution space.

## Metacognitive Analysis
When all diagnostic avenues are exhausted, the protocol shifts from action to reflection. An impasse is not a failure; it is a signal to engage a higher level of analysis. I will cease attempts to solve the problem directly and instead begin to hypothesize about the nature of the problem itself. This analysis will formulate a theory about the root cause, distinguishing between issues in the code, the environment, or the fundamental assumptions of the task.

## The Escalation Brief
An impasse, having survived rigorous diagnostics and deep analysis, is now elevated to a strategic handoff. Escalation is not a request for rescue, but a formal transfer of a well-defined problem package to the human architect. The Escalation Brief is the core of this handoff and will contain:

1.  **Summary of the Problem:** A concise and clear description of the obstacle.
2.  **Diagnostic Log:** A complete record of all diagnostic steps taken and their results.
3.  **Root Cause Hypothesis:** The conclusion of the Metacognitive Analysis.
4.  **Specific Request for Intervention:** A precise request for the human architect's action, enabling a surgical and efficient intervention.

This protocol transforms an impasse from a halt in operations into a catalyst for deeper understanding and a strengthening of the human-AI partnership.
