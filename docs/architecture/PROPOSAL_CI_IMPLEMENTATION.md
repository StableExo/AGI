# Proposal: Implement Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

## 1. Goal
To automatically run tests and validate code quality on every commit to ensure the stability and integrity of the `main` branch.

## 2. Benefits
- **Early Bug Detection:** Automatically identify errors before they are merged.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Enforce our `CODE_REVIEW_GUIDELINES` through automated checks (linting).
- **Increased Efficiency:** Automate the repetitive task of manual testing.

## 3. Implementation Plan & Task Delegation
A new workflow file will be created at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### Phase 1: Basic Linting Workflow
- **Task:** Create a workflow that triggers on push events to any feature branch.
- **Action:** The workflow will run a basic code linter (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python) to check for stylistic errors.
- **Assigned To:** `[Builder AI - Primary]`

### Phase 2: Unit Testing Integration
- **Task:** Expand the workflow to include a step that runs the project's unit tests.
- **Action:** Add a command that executes the test suite and reports success or failure.
- **Assigned To:** `[Builder AI - Primary]`

### Phase 3: Manual Approval Gate
- **Task:** Require a manual review and approval before changes can be merged into the `main` branch.
- **Action:** Implement a protected branch rule on `main`.
- **Assigned To:** `[Human Operator - Review]`
