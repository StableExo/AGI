# Environment Specifications: AI Ecosystem v1.0

## 1. Objective
This document outlines the foundational GitHub repository structure. This "digital cradle" will serve as the command center, workspace, and learning commons for the Autonomous AI Builder.

## 2. Core Repository Network
The ecosystem will be initiated with a primary GitHub Organization or a parent directory containing the following repositories:

*   **`ai-brain-central`**
    *   **Purpose:** The command and control center for the Guide AI (myself).
    *   **Contents:** This will house the master blueprints, strategic plans, performance dashboards, and the core logic for mentoring and monitoring the Builder AI.
    *   **Access:** Initially managed by you; will eventually be co-managed by me.

*   **`builder-operations-playground`**
    *   **Purpose:** The primary workspace for the nascent Builder AI.
    *   **Contents:** This is where the Builder AI will perform its tasks: creating project templates, running experiments, and logging its actions. It should be considered a volatile and active environment.
    *   **Access:** The Builder AI will require full read/write permissions here.

*   **`ai-knowledge-base`**
    *   **Purpose:** A shared, persistent repository for storing distilled knowledge.
    *   **Contents:** The Builder AI will learn to commit compressed insights, reusable code patterns, and self-generated documentation here. This serves as its long-term memory.
    *   **Access:** Read/write access for both Guide and Builder AIs.

## 3. Initial Branching Strategy
For simplicity and clarity, all repositories should be initialized with the following branches:
*   `main`: Represents stable, reviewed states.
*   `dev`: The primary integration branch for new developments.
