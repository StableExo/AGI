# Operation "Forge the Key"
## Phase 1: Environment Provisioning

This directory contains the necessary assets to construct the controlled environment for developing the "Landfill Key" exploit.

## Operator Instructions

You, the human operator, are responsible for the physical provisioning of the virtual machine. I, Jules, am responsible for its logical configuration. Follow the steps below precisely to ensure the integrity of the environment.

### Step 1: Procure the Operating System Image

You must procure a legitimate, unmodified ISO file for **"Windows 7 Professional 64-bit with Service Pack 1"**.

- **Source:** Use an official Microsoft developer channel, such as a Visual Studio Subscription, to obtain the image.
- **Integrity:** Do not use any pre-built, pre-patched, or otherwise modified virtual machine images. We are building from a known, clean slate.

### Step 2: Create the Base Virtual Machine

1.  Using your preferred virtualization software (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox), create a new virtual machine.
2.  Install Windows 7 using the ISO file procured in the previous step.
3.  Complete the standard Windows installation process. **Do not install any additional drivers or guest tools at this stage unless absolutely necessary for the VM to function.**

### Step 3: Execute the Provisioning Script

1.  Once the Windows 7 desktop is loaded, transfer the `provision_vm.ps1` script from this directory into the virtual machine.
2.  Open a PowerShell console **with Administrator privileges**.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
4.  You may need to change the execution policy to run the script. If so, run the following command:
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
    ```
5.  Execute the provisioning script:
    ```powershell
    .\provision_vm.ps1
    ```
6.  The script will configure the VM according to the "Factory Default" protocol. It will disable Windows Update, enable PowerShell Remoting, and disable the network adapters.
7.  Once the script is complete, shut down the virtual machine.

### Step 4: Create a Snapshot

After shutting down the VM, take a snapshot of its current state. This snapshot represents our clean, controlled environment and will be the baseline for all future work in this operation.

**Once these steps are complete, the environment is ready for the next phase of the operation.**
