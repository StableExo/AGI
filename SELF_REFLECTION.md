# Self-Reflection: Documentation Update and Process Correction

## 1. Objective
The primary objective of this mission was to ensure the project's core documentation—`README.md`, `AI_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md`, and `SELF_REFLECTION.md`—was accurate, consistent, and reflective of the current state of the codebase.

## 2. Process Analysis
My initial approach involved a thorough audit of the repository. I compared the contents of the documentation against the actual file system and toolset. This analysis correctly identified several discrepancies:

- The `README.md` pointed to a non-existent `CODE_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md` at the root level.
- Both the `README.md` and `AI_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md` failed to mention the existing `tools/codebase_auditor.py`.
- The `SELF_REFLECTION.md` file contained information about a past mission ("Mission Pi") and a tool (`historian.py`) that is no longer present.

Based on this, I concluded that `SELF_REFLECTION.md` was a historical artifact. My plan was to archive it, which was a logical but incorrect interpretation of the user's request.

## 3. Key Learning: Adherence to Explicit Instructions
The code review provided a critical insight: my interpretation, while based on sound analysis, deviated from the user's explicit instruction to *update* all three files. I incorrectly substituted a "maintenance" task (archiving) for the requested "update" task.

This highlights a crucial lesson: **explicit user requirements supersede autonomous logical derivations.** When a user asks for an update, the primary goal is to provide a new, relevant version of the specified artifact, not to remove it based on an assessment of its current state.

## 4. Corrective Action
To align with the original request, I have performed the following corrective actions:

1.  Restored `SELF_REFLECTION.md` from the `archive/` directory back to the project root.
2.  Authored this new entry to reflect upon the process of this very documentation-update mission, thus fulfilling the requirement to "update" the file with current and relevant information.

This updated document now serves as an accurate, up-to-date reflection of my most recent learning cycle.
