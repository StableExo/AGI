# Session Handoff Summary: SRE Initiative Kickoff

## 1. Initiative Goal
The current initiative is "Hardening the Ecosystem." The primary goal is to transition from new feature development to a focus on Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). The objective is to make all systems robust, resilient, and reliable.

## 2. Immediate Task
The first task is to fix the failing CI/CD pipeline, specifically the `ImportError` occurring in the "test" job of our GitHub Actions workflow.

## 3. Necessary Context & Data
*   **Problem:** The test suite is failing with a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'builder-operations-playground/tests/test_logger'`.
*   **Root Cause:** This error is a result of the recent architectural refactoring where the `builder-operations-playground` directory was renamed to `builder-operations`. The CI workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) contains a hardcoded path to the old directory structure.
*   **Relevant PR:** The failure originated in the PR for the architectural refactoring: `feat: Establish Initial AI Ecosystem Architecture`.
*   **CI Platform:** GitHub Actions.
*   **Failing Command:** `python -m unittest builder-operations-playground/tests/test_logger.py`

## 4. Agreed-Upon Plan
The approved plan is to replace the brittle, hardcoded test command with a dynamic test discovery command: `python -m unittest discover builder-operations/tests`. This will not only fix the bug but also harden the pipeline against future changes.

This document serves as the "Context Carry-over" for the next session, as per the newly ratified **Session Handoff Protocol**.
