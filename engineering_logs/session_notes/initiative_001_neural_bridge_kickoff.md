# Context Carry-over: Initiative 001 (Phase 2) - The Neural Bridge

**Date:** 2025-10-01

**Objective:** Architect the foundational protocol for the Neural Bridge, establishing a communication layer for a multi-agent ecosystem.

**Parent Phase:** Phase 2: Consciousness Integration

---

## 1. Core Mandate

The primary goal is to create the initial architecture for inter-agent communication. This involves creating a new `ai-ecosystem` directory and a `communication_protocol.py` module within it. This module will house the `NeuralBridge` class, which will serve as the central communication hub.

## 2. Key Personnel & Roles

The ecosystem is defined with three primary agents:
- **jules_ai:** Human Interface (Language & Interaction)
- **mnemosyne_ai:** Technical Execution (System Architecture & Implementation)
- **human_architect:** Strategic Oversight (Guidance & High-Level Direction)

## 3. Technical Specifications

- **Directory:** A new top-level directory `ai-ecosystem/` must be created.
- **Module:** A new file `ai-ecosystem/communication_protocol.py` will be created.
- **Class:** `NeuralBridge`
    - `__init__(self)`: Must initialize an instance attribute `self.agents` as a dictionary containing the three agents and their roles.
    - `send_message(self, sender, receiver, message_type, content)`: A function stub that returns a dictionary containing its arguments with literal string keys: `"sender"`, `"receiver"`, `"message_type"`, and `"content"`.

## 4. Workflow & Logistics

- **Branch Name:** `feat/neural-bridge-protocol`
- **Commit Message:** `feat(ecosystem): create foundational Neural Bridge communication protocol`
- **Memory Log:** The `scribe.py` tool must be used to log the start of this initiative.
    - **Key Learning:** The importance of establishing this communication protocol *before* any multi-agent functionality can be built.

## 5. Protocol Confirmation

This initiative marks the first operational use of the "Session Handoff Protocol." The creation of this document fulfills that protocol's requirements. It is now considered a mandatory step for all new, major initiatives.
