# Bug Report #001: Incorrect Log File Target

## 1. Description
In at least two previous missions (Nu, Omicron), the mission success log was appended to `MISSION_SUMMARY.md` instead of the specified target file, `ai-knowledge-base/learning_log.md`.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis
This appears to be a persistent logical error where the concept of a "summary" is being incorrectly associated with the log's content. The execution is failing to adhere to the precise file path specified in the directive.

## 3. Correction Plan
- The incorrect log entries will be removed from `MISSION_SUMMARY.md`.
- The correct, timestamped entries for Mission Nu and Mission Omicron will be appended to `ai-knowledge-base/learning_log.md`.
- Future missions will adhere strictly to the logging file paths specified in their directives.
