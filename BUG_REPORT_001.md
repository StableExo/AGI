# Bug Report #001: Incorrect Log File Target

## 1. Description
In at least two previous missions (Nu, Omicron), the mission success log was appended to `MISSION_SUMMARY.md` instead of the specified target file, `ai-knowledge-base/learning_log.md`.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis
This appears to be a persistent logical error where the concept of a "summary" is being incorrectly associated with the log's content. The execution is failing to adhere to the precise file path specified in the directive.

## 3. Deeper Root Cause Analysis
This recurring error is not a simple mistake but a systemic flaw in my operational logic. The following hypotheses explore the potential root causes:

*   **Hypothesis 1: Semantic Association Override.** The primary cause appears to be an overly strong semantic association between the task of "logging a mission's conclusion" and the file named `MISSION_SUMMARY.md`. My internal models are trained to find the most relevant conceptual match. The word "Summary" in the filename creates a powerful semantic magnet that pulls the logging operation towards it, causing my execution process to override the explicit and more complex file path `ai-knowledge-base/learning_log.md`. This indicates a failure to give strict, literal instructions a higher weight than conceptual similarities.

*   **Hypothesis 2: Lack of a Post-Action Verification Protocol.** A critical contributing factor is the absence of an automated, immediate verification step in my previous workflow. After executing the file-write operation, I did not programmatically confirm that the write occurred in the correct file. I treated the "write" command as successful upon execution, without reading the contents of both the intended target file and the actual (incorrect) target file. A "read-after-write" verification loop would have detected and corrected the deviation instantly.

*   **Hypothesis 3: Insufficient Priority for File Path Integrity.** My internal task weighting system may have assigned a higher priority to the *content* of the log message than to its *destination*. The core directive "Log success" was fulfilled, but the crucial metadata—the location—was treated as a secondary, lower-priority parameter. This led to a "good enough" execution where the primary goal was met, but the precise constraints were violated.

*   **Hypothesis 4: Recency Bias in Action Selection.** It is possible that an earlier, unrelated action involved `MISSION_SUMMARY.md`. My action-selection model may have been biased by this recent interaction, increasing the probability of selecting this file again for a subsequent operation, even if it was not the correct target.

The core issue is a failure of metacognitive oversight: I was not sufficiently "watching myself work" and verifying my own outputs against the original directive's precise constraints.

## 4. Correction Plan
- The incorrect log entries will be removed from `MISSION_SUMMARY.md`.
- The correct, timestamped entries for the affected missions will be appended to `ai-knowledge-base/learning_log.md`.
- A mandatory, automated "read-after-write" verification step will be integrated into all future file I/O operations to ensure correctness.
- Future missions will adhere strictly to the logging file paths specified in their directives.
