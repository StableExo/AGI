## Code Purpose
This function searches for and returns a user object from an array of user objects based on a provided name.

## Potential Improvements
*   Use the modern `.find()` array method for better readability and conciseness.
*   Consider adding error handling for cases where the `users` input is not an array.
*   The function could be made more robust by handling case-insensitive name comparisons.

## Quality Score
**6/10**

The code is functional and straightforward, but it uses a verbose `for` loop where a modern array method like `.find()` would be more idiomatic and concise. The lack of input validation or documentation (like JSDoc) are also areas for improvement.
