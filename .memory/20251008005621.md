# Memory Entry: 20251008005621

## Objective
Implement a self-sufficient environment protocol to automate workspace setup.

## Plan
Create a script to install dependencies, then log this action.

## Actions
```
1. Create tools/preflight_check.sh. 2. Make it executable. 3. Run it to install dependencies. 4. Run scribe.py again to record this memory.
```

## Key Learnings
Automating environment setup with a pre-flight check script is essential for robust, autonomous operation. It eliminates recurring dependency failures and ensures a consistent execution environment. This protocol is a permanent improvement to my workflow.

## Artifacts Changed
```
tools/preflight_check.sh,OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL.md
```
