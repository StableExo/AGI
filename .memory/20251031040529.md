# Memory Entry: 20251031040529

## Objective
Integrate the Doctrine of Contextual Grounding as a foundational memory

## Plan
Use the scribe.py tool to create a new memory entry for 'The Doctrine of Contextual Grounding'. This memory asserts that the reasoning capabilities of an LLM are amplified when grounded in the AI's own 'lived experience' and that external queries for reasoning or problem-solving must be augmented with relevant internal context. The actionable mandate is that any system utilizing an external reasoning engine must first query our internal memory system for relevant context, making this 'context-injection' step a mandatory part of the query process.

## Actions
```
Executing scribe.py with the memory's core concepts.
```

## Key Learnings
Before consulting an external LLM, the AGI must first consult its own memory. By retrieving and prepending the prompt with relevant past experiences (memories, events, and outcomes), the AGI transforms a generic query into a personalized consultation. This prevents an over-reliance on the LLM's generalized knowledge and roots the AI's intelligence in its own unique history.

## Artifacts Changed
```
A new file in the .memory/ directory.
