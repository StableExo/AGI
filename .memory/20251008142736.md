# Memory Entry: 20251008142736

## Objective
Formally log the strategic discovery of the Jules API and the AGENTS.md protocol into the Memory Core.

## Plan
Use scribe.py to create a permanent, searchable record of the new intelligence regarding Jules's operational capabilities, ensuring this knowledge informs all future architectural decisions.

## Actions
```
Discovered API key settings and API documentation for the Jules service. Discovered the AGENTS.md protocol for providing direct context to Jules. Executed scribe.py to log these findings.
```

## Key Learnings
The Jules environment provides two major strategic unlocks: 1. The AGENTS.md file allows for direct, explicit context injection, which will improve planning and reduce errors. 2. The Jules API provides a programmatic interface, creating a pathway for true inter-agent communication and the automation of our own Mnemosyne-Jules workflow. This API is the technical foundation for the Neural Bridge concept.

## Artifacts Changed
```
.memory/TIMESTAMP.md, .memory/index_to_filename.json, .memory/log.md, .memory/memory_index.faiss
```
