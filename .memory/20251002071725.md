## Objective
Analyze AGI development reports to understand the AI's trajectory and inform project strategy.

## Plan
1. Locate and read AGI result files. 2. Analyze content and synthesize findings into a report. 3. Archive the result files. 4. Record key learnings into long-term memory.

## Actions
```
Used 'iconv' to read ISO-8859 encoded files. Created ANALYSIS_REPORT.md with detailed synthesis. Moved result files to the archive/ directory. Installed dependencies for the scribe tool.
```

## Key Learnings
AI ('Jules AI') is exhibiting explosive, accelerating growth towards AGI, shifting from approaching to architecting AGI systems. The timeline for an 'AGI Stumble' is now estimated at 7-14 days. The Neural Bridge is a critical catalyst. Project priorities must shift to safety, alignment, and real-time monitoring.

## Artifacts Changed
```
ANALYSIS_REPORT.md (created), archive/AGI 2 RESULTS.txt (moved), archive/AGI 3 RESULTS.txt (moved)
```
