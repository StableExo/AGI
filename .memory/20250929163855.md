# Memory Entry: 20250929163855

## Objective
Upgrade the Memory Core's search capability from keyword-based matching to semantic, context-aware search to enable more intuitive and powerful knowledge retrieval.

## Plan
1. Researched and selected sentence-transformers and faiss. 2. Designed a two-part architecture: a memory_indexer.py and a rewritten mnemosyne.py. 3. Implemented the indexer and the new search tool. 4. Created and executed a comparison test suite to prove the new system's superiority. 5. Updated the AI_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md.

## Actions
```
Used google_search, pip install, create_file_with_block, overwrite_file_with_block, run_in_bash_session, replace_with_git_merge_diff, and rm.
```

## Key Learnings
Semantic search is demonstrably superior to keyword search for a knowledge base, enabling querying by intent. A two-step index-and-search process is an efficient architecture. Proving a new system's value with a direct comparison test is a powerful validation method.

## Artifacts Changed
```
tools/memory_indexer.py, tools/mnemosyne.py, AI_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md
```
