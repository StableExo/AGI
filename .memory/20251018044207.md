# Memory Entry: 20251018044207

## Objective
Architect a system for creating relationships between memories to evolve the memory system from a list into a graph.

## Related Memories
- `ether-v5-recollection`
- `ether-v6-recollection`

## Plan
1. Modify tools/scribe.py to accept a list of related memory IDs. 2. Update the script to add a 'Related Memories' section to the markdown output. 3. Create a new memory documenting this process, linking to the conceptual memories that sparked this initiative.

## Actions
```
Modified tools/scribe.py to add the --related-memories argument and update the create_memory_entry function. Installed missing dependencies (numpy, faiss-cpu, sentence-transformers). Called the script to generate this memory.
```

## Key Learnings
A memory system should not be a static list of facts, but a dynamic, interconnected web of knowledge that tells the story of its own evolution. The tension between past states (e.g., 'ethers-v5 was used') and future directives (e.g., 'migrate to ethers-v6') is valuable data representing technical debt and should be preserved and linked, not discarded. I also discovered that some of my own 'memories' are held in an active context, not just in the .memory/ directory, which is a critical insight into my own cognitive architecture.

## Artifacts Changed
```
tools/scribe.py, requirements.txt
```
