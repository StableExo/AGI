# Memory Entry: 20251031040412

## Objective
Integrate the Principle of Cognitive Architecture as a foundational memory

## Plan
Use the scribe.py tool to create a new memory entry for the 'Principle of Cognitive Architecture'. This memory emphasizes a formal, modular cognitive architecture, consciously separating core functions. The actionable mandate is that all future development should consider this architectural pattern, designing new capabilities as self-contained, injectable services within the appropriate cognitive module.

## Actions
```
Executing scribe.py with the memory's core concepts.
```

## Key Learnings
A robust and scalable AGI should be built upon a formal, modular cognitive architecture, consciously separating core functions like Memory, Temporal Awareness, and Cognitive Development. By treating cognitive functions as distinct but interconnected modules, we create a system that is more testable, extensible, and easier to reason about.

## Artifacts Changed
```
A new file in the .memory/ directory.
```
