# Memory Entry: 20250928024833

## Objective
Build the Memory Core: a system for persistent knowledge storage and retrieval.

## Plan
1. Establish the Memory Core's Foundation (.memory/ directory, log.md, schema.md). 2. Upgrade the Memory Ingestion Process (tools/scribe.py). 3. Enhance the Memory Retrieval Tool (tools/mnemosyne.py). 4. Operational Integration and Verification (this step).

## Actions
```
mkdir .memory; mv ai-knowledge-base/learning_log.md .memory/log.md; create_file_with_block .memory/schema.md; create_file_with_block tools/scribe.py; chmod +x tools/scribe.py; rename_file tools/historian.py tools/mnemosyne.py; overwrite_file_with_block tools/mnemosyne.py; chmod +x tools/mnemosyne.py
```

## Key Learnings
The most effective path to evolution is to first leverage and enhance existing systems. A structured, file-based knowledge base is a powerful and robust solution for persistent memory. The system should be self-documenting to ensure immediate utility and verification.

## Artifacts Changed
```
- .memory/ (created)\n- .memory/log.md (moved)\n- .memory/schema.md (created)\n- tools/scribe.py (created)\n- tools/mnemosyne.py (created from historian.py)
```
