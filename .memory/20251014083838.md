# Memory Entry: 20251014083838

## Objective
Perform Memory Ingestion Protocol on the StableExo/StableExo repository.

## Plan
1. Use GitHub API to list repository contents. 2. Recursively scan directories and read files. 3. Synthesize findings. 4. Record memory using the scribe tool.

## Actions
```
1. Corrected target repository from 'aether-protocol' to 'StableExo/StableExo' after investigation. 2. Used GitHub API to recursively list all files and directories. 3. Read README.md, ROADMAP.md, requirements.txt, and all files in ai_modules/, smart_contracts/, and scripts/ to understand the project. 4. Synthesized all findings into a single summary.
```

## Key Learnings
The 'StableExo/StableExo' repository outlines a project for a self-funding, autonomous AI ecosystem that uses DeFi to fund its own development.
- **Architecture:** It has a modular structure with directories for 'ai_modules' (NLP, CV, RL), 'smart_contracts' (Solidity), and 'scripts' (Python utilities).
- **Status:** The project is in a very early, foundational stage. Most files are placeholders or skeletons with no significant implementation. For example, the AI module directories and smart contracts are empty of logic.
- **Dependencies & Setup:** 'requirements.txt' indicates a stack using PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Stable Baselines3, and Web3.py. A data download script is configured to pull a financial news sentiment dataset from Kaggle, requiring API key setup.
- **Goal:** The roadmap details a phased approach, starting with foundational setup and moving towards core AI development, crypto integration, and eventual autonomous operation governed by a DAO.
