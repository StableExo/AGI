## Objective
Initiative 001 (Phase 2): Architect the foundational protocol for the Neural Bridge.

## Plan
1. Operationalize Session Handoff Protocol. 2. Create ai-ecosystem/ directory. 3. Implement NeuralBridge class in communication_protocol.py. 4. Log initiative. 5. Commit and deliver.

## Actions
```
Created engineering_logs/session_notes/initiative_001_neural_bridge_kickoff.md. Created ai-ecosystem/ directory. Created ai-ecosystem/communication_protocol.py with NeuralBridge class.
```

## Key Learnings
The importance of establishing a communication protocol before any multi-agent functionality can be built. Operationalizing the Session Handoff Protocol is a critical step for maintaining context in new, major initiatives.

## Artifacts Changed
```
engineering_logs/session_notes/initiative_001_neural_bridge_kickoff.md, ai-ecosystem/communication_protocol.py
```
