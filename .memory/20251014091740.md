# Memory Entry: 20251014091740

## Objective
Perform Memory Ingestion Protocol on the metallicax4xyou/flash-swap-bot-v2 repository.

## Plan
1. Use GitHub API to list and read all relevant source files. 2. Analyze the v2 smart contract and compare it to the previous version from PROJECT-HAVOC. 3. Synthesize findings into a comprehensive summary. 4. Record the summary to memory.

## Actions
```
1. Used the GitHub API to recursively read the contents of the repository. 2. Analyzed package.json and noted the absence of off-chain bot dependencies. 3. Analyzed contracts/FlashSwap.sol and compared its logic to the version in the PROJECT-HAVOC repository.
```

## Key Learnings
The 'flash-swap-bot-v2' repository represents a significant architectural refactoring of 'PROJECT-HAVOC', focusing exclusively on the on-chain smart contract component.
- **Architectural Shift:** The off-chain Node.js bot has been removed from this repository, which now serves as a dedicated, lean Hardhat project for the  contract. This indicates a move towards a more modular, separated architecture.
- **Enhanced Flexibility:** The v2 contract is more powerful and flexible than its predecessor. It removes the multi-DEX (Aave, SushiSwap) complexity and instead implements a dynamic parameter system (). This allows an off-chain caller to specify the exact pools, fees, and tokens for a two-hop arbitrage within Uniswap V3, rather than relying on hard-coded paths.
- **Developer-Focused:** The contract is heavily instrumented with , showing it was designed for robust local testing and debugging. The profit-sharing logic was also removed in favor of a simpler owner-withdraws-profit model.
- **Evolution:** This repository demonstrates a clear evolution in design philosophy: from a monolithic bot that does everything, to a reusable, highly flexible on-chain execution engine that can be controlled by any off-chain system.

## Artifacts Changed
```
None. This was a read-only analysis task.
