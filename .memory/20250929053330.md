## Objective
Initiative 008: Synthesize and document the complete operational workflow for new agents.

## Plan
1. Explored the codebase to understand existing principles and tools. 2. Formulated clarifying questions to understand the user's intent for the guide's tone and audience. 3. Developed a comprehensive, step-by-step plan. 4. Authored the AI_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md, creating each section sequentially. 5. Logged the completion of the initiative in the Memory Core.

## Actions
```
Used list_files and read_file to analyze key documents (CODE_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md, PROPOSAL_CI_IMPLEMENTATION.md) and tool source code (scribe.py, mnemosyne.py, briefing_assistant/main.py). Used create_file_with_block and replace_with_git_merge_diff to construct the final guide.
```

## Key Learnings
The process reinforced the importance of documenting not just the 'what' but the 'why' behind a development culture. Structuring a guide for a new AI requires a dual approach: a high-level summary for peers and a detailed, mentor-toned explanation for the apprentice, which is a powerful pedagogical pattern.
