## Objective
Begin implementation of the Gemini Citadel Off-Chain Brain by building the foundational Data Service module.

## Plan
1. Verify repository state and dependencies. 2. Create the workspace directory structure (src/services/). 3. Implement the initial connection to an RPC provider. 4. Develop logic to fetch real-time pool and price data. 5. Create a standardized in-memory representation of the market state.

## Actions
```
git status, cat docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, cat package.json, mkdir, touch, python3 tools/scribe.py
```

## Key Learnings
The initiation of a major new development cycle must begin with a formal protocol: system verification, workspace setup, and the logging of intent. This establishes a robust and repeatable foundation for complex work, mitigating the risks of project decay seen in past initiatives like Axion Citadel.

## Artifacts Changed
```
gemini-citadel/src/services/data.service.ts, .memory/TIMESTAMP.md
```
