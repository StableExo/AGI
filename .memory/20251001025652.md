## Objective
To restructure the repository to align with the AI Autonomy Blueprint, establishing the foundational architecture for the Builder AI's development environment.

## Plan
1. Initialize the environment using setup.sh. 2. Rename and refactor existing directories and files to match the new architecture. 3. Create the Builder AI's dedicated workspace and log file. 4. Create the first source code file for the Builder AI to begin Phase 1 development.

## Actions
```
Executed setup.sh after setting the AGI_BUILDER_PAT. Renamed 'builder-operations-playground' to 'builder-operations'. Moved and refactored 'ai-ecosystem/neural_bridge.py' to 'ai-brain-central/communication_protocol.py'. Created 'builder-operations/learning_logs/AI_BUILDER_LOG.md' and 'builder-operations/src/auth_manager.py'.
```

## Key Learnings
The environment setup is critically dependent on the AGI_BUILDER_PAT token. Existing repository components can be refactored into the new architecture. Verifying filesystem state after each step is crucial to track changes accurately.

## Artifacts Changed
```
builder-operations/, ai-brain-central/communication_protocol.py, builder-operations/learning_logs/AI_BUILDER_LOG.md, builder-operations/src/auth_manager.py
```
