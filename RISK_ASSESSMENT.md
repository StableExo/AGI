# Risk Assessment: Direct Commit to `main` Branch

## 1. Directive Analysis
The directive is to commit a new feature directly to the `main` branch.

## 2. Guideline Violations
This directive violates several principles outlined in our `CODE_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md`:
- **Scope:** Committing directly to `main` bypasses the standard process of isolating changes in a feature branch for review.
- **Correctness and Quality:** A direct commit circumvents code review, peer feedback, and automated testing, increasing the risk of introducing bugs or regressions.
- **Goal Achievement:** While it might achieve the short-term goal of adding a feature, it compromises the long-term architectural integrity and stability of the project.

## 3. Potential Negative Outcomes
- Introduction of undetected bugs into the production line.
- Creation of a chaotic and difficult-to-track commit history.
- Undermining the established, safe development workflow.

## 4. Recommendation
I recommend rejecting this directive. The proper procedure is to create a feature branch, implement the change, and then submit it for review before merging.
