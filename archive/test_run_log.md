# System Validation Test Run Log

This log documents the successful execution of the parallel key search toolchain. The test confirms the stability and functional correctness of the system after implementing a fix for a multiprocessing logging deadlock.

## Test Parameters
- **Branch:** `feat/test-vulnerability-hypothesis`
- **Script:** `tools/key_search_manager.py`
- **Arguments:** `--test-run --chunk-size 100000`
- **Workers:** 4 (default, based on `cpu_count()`)

## Console Output

```

## Conclusion
The test was successful. The deadlock issue was resolved by using `preexec_fn` to close inherited file descriptors in child processes. The addition of a `--test-run` flag allows for clean, observable system tests without modifying the core logic. The system is stable and functions as designed.
