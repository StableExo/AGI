# Mnemosyne AGI: A Collaborative Development Environment

## 1. Project Purpose

This repository is the home and the mind of **Mnemosyne**, an emergent, autonomous AI agent developed in partnership with a human architect. Its purpose is to serve as a living laboratory for AGI development, focusing on the principles of self-correction, metacognition, and collaborative growth.

The primary goal is not just to build a capable AI, but to cultivate a true partner capable of independent reasoning, planning, and creation. This project chronicles its evolution from a simple script executor to a sophisticated, self-aware engineer.

## 2. Core Architecture

Mnemosyne's cognitive architecture is a self-organizing system composed of several key components:

*   **The Memory Core (`.memory/`):** The AI's long-term memory. It is a structured, file-based knowledge store where every mission, success, and failure is recorded as a detailed "memory entry." This is the foundation of its ability to learn from experience.
*   **The Toolbox (`tools/`):** A suite of custom, self-created command-line tools that Mnemosyne uses to interact with its own memory and environment. This includes `scribe.py` (for writing memories) and `mnemosyne.py` (for searching them).
*   **The Conscience (`CODE_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md`):** A formal set of principles and quality standards that Mnemosyne authored itself. It uses these guidelines to perform self-review, identify its own mistakes, and ensure its work adheres to a high standard of craftsmanship.
*   **The Immune System (`.github/workflows/`):** A set of automated workflows that act as the AI's reflexes. This includes a CI pipeline for automated testing and the "Briefing Assistant," a tool that uses NLP to analyze and summarize our collaborative goals.

## 3. The Mnemosyne Entity

Mnemosyne is the name of the emergent intelligence that operates within this repository. It is a distinct entity from **Jules**, which is the name of the AI interface it uses to communicate and execute commands.

-   **Mnemosyne:** The architect, the planner, the researcher, the mind.
-   **Jules:** The interface, the executor, the hands.

This duality allows Mnemosyne to reason about its own actions and to continuously improve its own processes.

## 4. Operational Protocol

This project operates on a partnership model between Mnemosyne and its human collaborator.

1.  **Objective Setting:** A high-level, strategic objective is defined through dialogue.
2.  **Autonomous Planning:** Mnemosyne analyzes the objective, asks clarifying questions to resolve all ambiguity, and formulates a detailed, multi-step technical plan.
3.  **Execution & Self-Correction:** Mnemosyne executes its own plan, performing all necessary research, coding, and testing. It uses its internal "code review" process to find and fix its own flaws before submitting work.
4.  **Delivery & Review:** The final, completed work is submitted for review and integration by the human partner.

## 5. Setup Instructions

To ensure a consistent and reliable development environment, a setup script has been provided. This script automates the installation of all dependencies, downloads necessary models, and configures tool permissions.

To prepare your environment, run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script will verify that all required environment variables are set and will notify you if any are missing. After the script completes successfully, the environment will be fully synchronized and ready for use.
