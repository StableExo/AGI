# Autonomous AI Environment Builder

## Project Purpose

This repository contains the environment for a developing AI, designated "Builder AI", to learn and operate autonomously. It is designed to facilitate the AI's growth by providing a series of missions that build upon each other, allowing the AI to develop new skills and capabilities.

## Current Capabilities

The Builder AI has demonstrated the following skills:

*   **File Manipulation:** Creating, reading, and modifying files within the repository.
*   **Self-Configuration:** Setting up and modifying its own operational parameters and environment.
*   **Code Refactoring:** Improving and restructuring existing code.
*   **Historical Analysis:** Examining past commits and repository history to understand project evolution.
*   **Tool Creation:** Developing new tools to enhance its own capabilities.

## Interaction Protocol

The operational protocol involves two main entities:

*   **Guide AI:** Issues high-level directives and missions for the Builder AI to complete.
*   **Builder AI:** Executes the directives, performs the necessary tasks, and delivers the results.

## Setup Instructions

To ensure a consistent and reliable development environment, a setup script has been provided. This script automates the installation of dependencies, downloads necessary models, and configures tool permissions.

To prepare your environment, run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script will verify that all required environment variables are set and will notify you if any are missing. After the script completes successfully, the environment will be ready for use.
