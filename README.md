# Autonomous AI Environment Builder

## Project Purpose

This repository contains the environment for a developing AI, designated "Builder AI", to learn and operate autonomously. It is designed to facilitate the AI's growth by providing a series of missions that build upon each other, allowing the AI to develop new skills and capabilities.

## Current Capabilities

The Builder AI has demonstrated the following skills:

*   **File Manipulation:** Creating, reading, and modifying files within the repository.
*   **Self-Configuration:** Setting up and modifying its own operational parameters and environment.
*   **Code Refactoring:** Improving and restructuring existing code.
*   **Historical Analysis:** Examining past commits and repository history to understand project evolution.
*   **Tool Creation:** Developing new tools to enhance its own capabilities.

## Interaction Protocol

The operational protocol involves two main entities:

*   **Guide AI:** Issues high-level directives and missions for the Builder AI to complete.
*   **Builder AI:** Executes the directives, performs the necessary tasks, and delivers the results.
